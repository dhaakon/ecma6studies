Create a series of programmatic exercises visualizing thought and
learning process. Be completely honest. Treat the medium as a craft and
be tohrough in the exploration for something different. Try to articulate the visual
perception. Recreate what you seeâ€”in your head. Leverage a community to create
something unique for its time. Understand the humility of the endeavor
and try to keep up with the currant.

In a few years this will seem archaic as it already is losing steam from
my thoughts to my fingertips. 

I'd like to understand better concepts in math.
